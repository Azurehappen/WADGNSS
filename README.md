This repository provides open-source software and documentation that implements a client-server architecture for computing common-mode GPS pseudorange error corrections and communicating them to a receiver. The information for the corrections is computed from information sources available in real-time over the internet. The server accesses that information, computes the common-mode error correction for a client specified location, and communicates the correction using the NTRIP protocol using RTCM message types 1001 and 1005 to the receiver.
